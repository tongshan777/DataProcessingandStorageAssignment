## Data Processing and Storage Assignment

This project implements an in-memory key-value database that supports transactional operations.It is implemented in c++, and requires CLion to develop and execute.

## How to run the code
Please follow these steps to run the code using CLion:

Step 1: Download and install CLion:

-Windows: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/

-macOS: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/download-thanks.html?platform=macM1

-Linux: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/download-thanks.html?platform=linux


Step 2: Install a C++ compiler (g++ or Clang) based on your operating system:

1. Run the code in termimal:

- Windows:

  Download MinGW-w64: [MinGW-w64 Download](https://www.mingw-w64.org/).
  
  Follow the installation guide and add `g++` to your system PATH.
       
- macOS:

  bash
  
  xcode-select

  --install

- Linux:
  
  bash
  
  sudo apt update
  
  sudo apt install g++ clang

2. Verify the compiler installation:
   bash
   
   g++ --version
   
   clang++ --version
   

Step 3: Clone the Repository:

1. run the code in termimal:
git clone https://github.com/tongshan777/DataProcessingandStorage.git

Step 4: Launch CLion and open the cloned project dictory

Step 5: Build and Run

1. Click the Build button in CLion to compile the program
2. Click Run to run the progame


## Thought on future Assignment:
Specific examples of standard and specific input and output can be given to make the completion and grading of the whole job more clear and accurate. For example, giving specific output content can better understand and better to grade the assignment. Some parts that like return NULL may be replaced with specific explanations and digital output, so that the logical operation rules of function can be understood more clearly and in detail.
